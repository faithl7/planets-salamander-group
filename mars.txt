The planet is colder than Earth, but the surface is a beautiful red color.
Acclimatization exercises and simulations of Mars'atmospheric conditions may be recommended for the team before the mission
to allow for better adjustment to mars’ climate.
Many previous robotic missions to Mars mean that the planet is more well known, making risk assessment for crewed mission easier.
Mars frequently has dust storms, lasting up to a couple of months.
