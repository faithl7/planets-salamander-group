The planet is colder than Earth, but the surface is a beautiful red color.
Acclimatization exercises and simulations of Mars'atmospheric conditions may be recommended for the team before the mission
to allow for better adjustment to marsâ€™ climate.
Many previous robotic missions to Mars mean that the planet is more well known, making risk assessment for crewed mission easier.
Mars frequently has dust storms, lasting up to a couple of months.
Is there life on mars? If yes, it would be important to know if it is well-disposed towards humans.
