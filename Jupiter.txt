The planet is further from the sun than the earth resulting in much colder temperatures that may be unconducive for
potential landers.

Jupiter has the largest number of moons in the solar system, with four large (can be visible from earth using a telescope),
and many smaller ones. The larger moons would be fascinating to observe and study further from closer proximity. 

Furthermore, Jupiter is a gas planet without a solid surface, making a landing there nearly impossible.

Of our three options, Jupiter is the furthest away from earth.
