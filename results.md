#Planetary landers mission to Mars, Jupiter and Venus
##Possibility of sending teams to the planets for exploration

Discussions were had amongst the planning team concerning the feasibility of exploring these planets. A couple of factors were
considered in the decision making and recommendations made for the most viable mission option to allocate resources on.


###Mars
Based on the research data available on the planet, the close similarity to earth compared to the other planets examined and the 
availability of resources that could be allocated to Mars' exploration, a mission on Mars seems more practical.

###Jupiter
Being a  gaseous planet with no solid surface and extremely low temperatures,makes Jupiter an unstable destination for our mission.

###Venus
Despite it's gravity being closely related to that of earth, other properties considered like extremely high temperatures, very
low visibility and overall unstable atmosphere makes venus a unlikely destination to send our teams for exploration.

##Conclusion
Mars is probably the most viable option for our planetary landers mission.
Its climatic conditions are less extreme than those of Venus.
Jupiter is right out.
